## Overview

This is a Flask web app which predicts the delivery time of items in an e-commerce business.You need to fill out the details of your order and prediction will be made for how much time it takes to have your item delivered to you.

## Motivation

I started learning Data Science early last year after more than 12 years in finance and accounting background. I Started with machine learning first and i am gradually working on Deep Learning with a focus on Natural Processing Language. I believe it is important to work on real world application to be able to gain mastery in Data Science.

## Installation

The Code is written in Python 3.9.16. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:

```command prompt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
